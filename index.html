      <p> Hi! Welcome to the Ecosystem website. Sorry to let you down unfortunately, we're experiencing
      some technical difficulties, but the website originally included a flow chart of our
      revenue model as well as some digital/aesthetic prototypes that we made in 3D modelling 
      software. If you wish to view these, please contact us on the contact info provided on the application
      and we will be happy to send it through!</p>

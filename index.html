      <p> Hi! Welcome to the Ecosystem website. Sorry to let you down unfortunately, we're experiencing
      some technical difficulties, but the website originally included a flow chart of our
      revenue model as well as some digital/aesthetic prototypes that we made in 3D modelling 
      software. </p>
